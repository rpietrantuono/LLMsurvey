While ideally I can use something like ChatGPT or ClaudeGPT or something else, I want to my GPT to have a specific tone when providing responses.  <strong>This part is very important.</strong></p>
<p>Would it make more sense to use a prebuilt GPT and somehow get it to respond in the right way?  OR, do I have to create my GPT from scratch?</p>
<p>Hence, I'm wondering how difficult/resources it would take for me to develop my GPT?  To see if it's a viable option.</p>

"46067","How do transformer models handle negation in sentiment analysis","2024-06-25 00:58:21","","0","61","<transformer><attention><gpt><bert>","<p>I'm trying to understand how transformer models, such as BERT or GPT, handle negation in sentiment analysis. Specifically, I'm curious about how these models manage to correctly interpret sentences where negation changes the sentiment, such as &quot;The movie is not good.&quot;</p>
<p>A simple model using word embeddings + global averaging fails to handle negation properly. Intuitively, for example, if &quot;good&quot; has a positive sentiment score and &quot;bad&quot; has a negative sentiment score, a model might misinterpret &quot;not good&quot; by simply averaging the scores of &quot;not&quot; and &quot;good&quot;.</p>
<h3>Example Without Negation</h3>
<p>Consider the following sentences with sentiment words:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;The movie is good.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The movie is awesome.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The movie is terrible.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose we have the following word embeddings representing sentiment scores:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;good&quot; = [10]</li>
<li>&quot;awesome&quot; = [12]</li>
<li>&quot;terrible&quot; = [-10]</li>
</ul>
<p>Neutral words (assuming embeddings around 0):</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;the&quot; = [0]</li>
<li>&quot;movie&quot; = [0]</li>
<li>&quot;is&quot; = [0]</li>
</ul>
<p>For these sentences, a simple global average of the sentiment scores works well:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;The movie is good&quot; = average([0, 0, 0, 10]) = 10 / 4 = 2.5 (positive sentiment)</li>
<li>&quot;The movie is awesome&quot; = average([0, 0, 0, 12]) = 12 / 4 = 3 (positive sentiment)</li>
<li>&quot;The movie is terrible&quot; = average([0, 0, 0, -10]) = -10 / 4 = -2.5 (negative sentiment)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example With Negation</h3>
<p>Now, consider the sentence &quot;The movie is not good.&quot; In this case, the sentiment should be negative due to the presence of &quot;not.&quot; However, averaging the scores naively might not handle this correctly. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;The movie is not good&quot; = average([0, 0, 0, -5 (for not), 10 (for good)]) = (0 + 0 + 0 - 5 + 10) / 5 = 5 / 5 = 1 (incorrectly positive)</li>
<li>&quot;The movie is not bad&quot; = average([0, 0, 0, -5, -9]) = (0 + 0 + 0 - 5 - 9) / 5 = -14 / 5 = -2.8 (incorrectly negative)</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Transformers Handle Negation</h3>
<p>Can someone explain, with a concrete example, how a transformer model like BERT or GPT can correctly understand and model negation in a sentence? Specifically, I'm interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>How the self-attention mechanism captures the relationship between words like &quot;not&quot; and &quot;good&quot;.</li>
<li>An example with numerical values to illustrate the process.</li>
</ul>

(2018) and &quot;Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-training&quot; by Alec Radford et al. (2018).</p>
<p>I have understand that the largest difference between BERT and GPT is the direction of the context. BERT is bidirectional, while GPT is unidirectional. I have understand the difference visually thorugh Figure 3 of the BERT paper.
However, I have question about how the difference is achieved in more detailed level, such as implementation level. I have understand that the shortest way is to look at the code, but I am wondering if there is any explanation in the paper.
Especially, I am wondering how multiple outputs from previous transformer layers are combined as the input of the next layer in BERT (or so does GPT).</p>
<p>I have also looked at the paper &quot;Attention is All You Need&quot; by Vaswani et al. (2017) and found the following equation
<span class=""math-container"">$$ Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V $$</span>
, but I am not sure about where does it implies the unidirectional context in the transformer architecture. (I think original transformer is unidirectional.)</p>
<p>I would appreciate it if you could explain how the bidirectional context is achieved in BERT.</p>

On page 3 of the paper he gave a &quot;naive&quot; approach to build the attention matrix by a simple dot product of the input vector <span class=""math-container"">$X$</span> (then passing through a softmax function) - given input vector <span class=""math-container"">$X$</span> (a <span class=""math-container"">$D \times N$</span> matrix) we can calculate the <span class=""math-container"">$n, n'$</span>-th entry of the attention matrix <span class=""math-container"">$A$</span> as:</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$$A_{n,n'} = \frac{\exp( \textbf{x}_n^\top  \textbf{x}_{n'})}{\sum_{n''=1}^N \exp(\textbf{x}_{n''}^\top \textbf{x}_{n'})}$$</span></p>
<p>Written in matrix form it would be:</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$$A = \text{softmax}(X^{\top}X)$$</span></p>
<p>Where <span class=""math-container"">$\text{softmax}(M)$</span> means to apply the regular softmax function to each <em>column</em> of the matrix <span class=""math-container"">$M$</span>.</p>
<p>He later on explained that this approach &quot;entangles information about the similarity between locations in the sequence with the content of the sequence itself&quot;, and thus improving it by applying a linear transformation <span class=""math-container"">$U$</span> to the vector <span class=""math-container"">$\textbf{x}_n$</span>:</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$$A_{n,n'} = \frac{\exp( \textbf{x}_n^\top U^\top U \textbf{x}_{n'})}{\sum_{n''=1}^N \exp(\textbf{x}_{n''}^\top U^\top U \textbf{x}_{n'})}$$</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$$A = \text{softmax}(X^\top U^\top UX)$$</span></p>
<p>And later, he again improving it further by using two separate linear transformations <span class=""math-container"">$U_k$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$U_q$</span>, since &quot;the numerator
in this construction is symmetric and this could be a disadvantage&quot;:</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$$A_{n,n'} = \frac{\exp \left( \textbf{x}_n^\top U_{\textbf{k}}^\top U_{\textbf{q}}^{} \textbf{x}_{n'} \right)}{\sum_{n''=1}^N \exp \left(\textbf{x}_{n''}^\top U_{\textbf{k}}^\top U_{\textbf{q}}^{} \textbf{x}_{n'}\right)}$$</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><span class=""math-container"">$$ A = \text{softmax}(X^\top U_k^\top U_qX)$$</span></p>
<p>My problem is that the exact disadvantage of the two approaches above and the exact improvements each new approach provides isn't explained very clearly in the paper. Is it possible for anyone to offer a more detailed (both intuitively and mathematically) explanation on the disadivantage of each of the naive approaches and how the improvement would help?</p>

<p>As I understand, instruction datasets typically have 3 components: (a) the instruction (b) the output/response, and (c) and an optional input. Now, according to this <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10792.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">paper</a>: &quot;Based on the collected IT dataset, a pretrained model can be directly fine-tuned in a fully-supervised manner, where given the instruction and the input, the model is trained by predicting each token in the output sequentially.&quot; This makes sense to me, i.e, the response/output is the ground truth the model is expected to predict.</p>
<p>However, when I check many tutorials (e.g., this <a href=""https://github.com/philschmid/deep-learning-pytorch-huggingface/blob/main/training/instruction-tune-llama-2-int4.ipynb"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tutorial notebook</a>), it seems that instructions, inputs, and outputs are all combined into a single text sample. But I can't tell from the notebook how the training now works. What is now the ground truth for the supervised training. Or is this now treated as a next-word-prediction task?</p>
<p>What am I missing? Or are these indeed two different approaches for instruction tuning. Sorry if those a stupid questions!</p>

<code>(operand_1+operand_2)%mod_value</code>.</p>
<p>The expectation for this demo is for the train loss to quickly decrease while the test loss remains high due to memorization. Then the model &quot;groks&quot;, meaning learns the generalized solution, and slowly transitions from memorization to this solution.</p>
<p>As a result, the test loss plummets much farther into training
I'm implementing the transformer from scratch with TinyGrad. I prefer TinyGrad since I understand it a lot better than PyTorch(debugging is easier) and it offers better METAL accelerator support. This model is simpler than the typical transformer -- it doesn't have biases or normalization, and we train over the entire training set in a single batch. The optimizer is AdamW with a very high weight decay to encourage faster generalization.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, I've properly matched the parameters stated in the original material. I assume it's a bug with my Transformer code -- this implementation was based off <a href=""https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/blob/2befdf86d9f992f5d4f081122088b39688b153d0/extra/models/transformer.py#L41"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>, but I removed the unnecessary components.

For example, when predicting the 6th token in the sequence we shouldn't have access to the 7th token.</p>
<p>However, why can't the decoder perform full self attention on all previously predicted tokens? When predicting the 6th token, why can't the third token embedding have access to the 5th token. Wouldn't this system of representation offer richer context. Some explanations that I have seen online have stated that this system would violate the nature of autoregressive token generation, however we still aren't looking at the 7th token or anything after to predict the sixth token, we are just allowing all the already predicted tokens to attend to each other. The presence of every single token in a generated sequence is only the result of everything that came before it which still sounds very autoregressive.</p>

<strong>Allowing available tokens to attend to each other would violate the autoregressive property and potentially introduce information leakage from future tokens, leading to incorrect predictions.</strong></p>
<p>I'm not sure what this really means or where exactly the information leakage would be coming from, since the 6th token would have no information about the 7th.

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Me8rq.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Me8rq.png"" alt=""Algorithm 10 from &quot;Formal Algorithms for Transformers&quot; by Mary Phung and Marcus Hutter"" /></a>: <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/ZWC9o.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://i.sstatic.net/ZWC9o.png</a></p>
<p>Previously I thought that the maximum context length is very much <strong>built into</strong> the transformer, for example as the dimension of a layer of weights. After studying this algorithm I am surprised because it seems more like an <strong>artificial restriction</strong>! Because this is a topic of active research I would like to know if I am misunderstanding something.</p>
<p>The way I see it, if I had access to the weights of GPT-2 right now, I could almost execute it on any number of tokens I like right away (If I had sufficient memory to compute this). The MHA algorithm is just carried out over a larger sequenece. There are only two issues, which are points where the context window <span class=""math-container"">$l_{max}$</span> appears:</p>
<ol>
<li>The positional encoding has only <span class=""math-container"">$l_{max}$</span> positions</li>
<li>During training the weights were never optimized to attend over more than <span class=""math-container"">$l_{max}$</span> tokens.</li>
</ol>
<p>But these issues seem rather easy to resolve:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use some positional encoding which has infinitely many positions. The first encoding vectors are nicely spread around while the later ones are closer to eachother, due to the nature of fitting an infinite sequence of vectors into more or less a unit ball/sphere. But this is not an issue: It is natural for the positional encoding to become more vague as the token is further and further in the past.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Train 50% on context lengths around <span class=""math-container"">$l_{max}$</span>, 25% on context lengths around <span class=""math-container"">$2 l_{max}$</span>, 12.5% on context lengths around <span class=""math-container"">$4 l_{max}$</span> and so on...</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I can imagine the following issues appearing:</p>
<p>A) Memory becomes larger than what is available on a single &quot;unit&quot; (GPU?) so you have to start moving data back and forth to execute your transformer, which is just terribly inefficient during training and also inference, so it is really pointless to train on such large context windows.</p>
<p>B) Perhaps the transformer just doesn't learn well with this procedure for some reason.</p>
<p>These issues are still rather &quot;soft&quot; issues though. As far as I can tell, I could use the architecture of GPT-2 (modified positional encoding) to create 1000000 context window LLMs, in theory. So, am I missing something?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

To craft good prompts it seems important to have a good understanding of how the generative model works...</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>
How many tokens ahead does GPT 3.5 look with its beam search feature?</p>

I tried asking BingChat about GPT-3.5 beam search length: BingChat replied that it was 10 tokens but could only give a 'reference' to an OpenAI API page which did not seem to support the claim. I couldn't find any other results online.</p>
<p><strong>Why I care?</strong> Suppose I have a long theatre review and want to score how impressed the critic was by the quality of acting on a scale of: -5 extremely unimpressed to +5 extremely impressed.
My prompts currently ask the model to finish the reply with a sentence in the form:
&quot;Overall the critic was very impressed by the quality of acting - score 4.&quot;
But perhaps by asking the model to continue generation I can make the prompts more reliable. E.g. I could ask the model to subsequently explain the score with a quotation from the text; e.g. along the lines of
&quot;Overall the critic was very impressed by the quality of acting - score 4/5 - and indeed that 'Mark Strong's performance stole the show'&quot;</p>
<p>Knowing beam search length would really help me design prompts like these (which ask for the continuation of text after a numerical score to improve reliability).</p>

<h2>Third technique: Concatenating samples</h2>
<p>In this technique, we concatenate samples, separating them with a EOS token (E) until they reach the context length. In this way, we have no padding tokens, and the entire context length is used. The attention mask keeps track of where the EOS tokens occur.</p>
<pre><code>Context window:
   -----------------

   ###E############# (1 and part of 2)
batch 2:
   ###E####E######## (rest of 2, 3 and part of 4)

<p>With this technique, we reduce the number of batches, and only have to pad the final batch if necessary. However, it is unclear to me whether this is &quot;allowed&quot; for causal language modelling, as it is unclear whether this will cause the causal attention mechanism to attend to tokens from previous samples, only ignoring the EOS token (instead of everything before it)</p>

One downside is that they require a huge amount of resources to train, and still a lot of resources for inference, such that most models can't run inference on consumer hardware.

<p>I have been following a lot of the ideas of using Pre-training methods on neural networks, to improve the accurancy of those networks on subsequent tasks. For example, the <strong>Word2Vec</strong> paper and others in that same line developed the idea of pretraining word embeddings, as a way to improve subsequent tasks like text translation. Transformer networks themselves being with converting raw data through content and positional embedding layers.</p>
<p>There are other examples of this idea as well. Chris Re at Stanford has explored the idea of &quot;weak supervision&quot; where a neural network is trained on a set of weak or noisy labels--that are cheap to obtain. After training on the weak labels, the network is trained on some higher quality labeled data to gain greater accuracy.</p>
<p>In images, this approach has had a little less success, but still attempted. There has been work on trying to pretrain a neural network on in-painting sections of an image. Once the network is pre-trained, then ML engineers will use that model to try and generate new images, or to improve performance on image segmentation tasks.</p>
<p>So in each of these cases, the model is trained on one task as a way to embed domain knowledge into the network for subsequent tasks. However, I have never really read an
explicit explanation or elaboration on this theory. I was wondering if anyone knew of
a good reference--paper, article, book, etc.--that discusses this theory and its approaches, limitation, etc.</p>

<p>But there was also a surprise. The OpenAI researchers discovered that in making the models bigger, they didn’t just get better at producing text.

</li>
<li><p>Do we have any idea how wide the scope of this kind of &quot;instruction following&quot; is? I.e. can the models make sense and respond &quot;sensibly&quot; (not correctly - I am not concerned with the correctness of the response, but with its relation to the instruction) to <em>any</em> instruction related to text?

"38843","Would it be possible to involve a proof assistant in the process of training a LLM?","2023-01-21 23:13:00","38900","2","1048","<natural-language-processing><recurrent-neural-networks><proofs><gpt><automated-theorem-proving>","<p>LLMs like GPT-3 have been shown capable of outputting highly complex code. Sadly, actually using them to replace a programmer's job has two major caveats:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>LLMs are notoriously bad at producing complex algorithms</p>
</li>
<li><p>It isn't possible to check whether the outputted code is correct</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As such, while something like ChatGPT will easily translate between different syntaxes, and even produce useful code, that is limited, to an extent, to code it has already seen. Fortunately, the (2) problem already has a solution: a <strong>proof checker</strong>. Certain languages have these built in, including Lean, Coq, Agda, Idris and Kind. As an example, suppose you wrote the following prompt, asking for an algorithm in Agda:</p>
<pre><code>Complete the following Agda function, which negates a boolean:

not : Bool -&gt; Bool
</code></pre>
<p>A LLM could fill it incorrectly, as follows:</p>
<pre><code>not : Bool -&gt; Bool
not true  = true
not false = false
</code></pre>
<p>But the cool thing is, in a proof assistant, you're able to enrich the type arbitrarily, and turn it into a complete specification of the program you desire. As such, you could prevent the issue above as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Complete the following Agda function:

not : (in : Bool) -&gt; Sigma (out : Bool) (in != out)
</code></pre>
<p>This type <strong>demands</strong> that the implementation of <code>not</code> comes accompanied by a proof that the output is, indeed, different from the input. Suppose that we did that, and the Ai still produced an incorrect algorithm:</p>
<pre><code>not : (in : Bool) -&gt; Sigma Bool (λout -&gt; in != out)
not true  = MkSigma true  &lt;proof_here&gt;
not false = MkSigma false &lt;proof_here&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In that case, it wouldn't be able to fill the <code>&lt;proof_here&gt;</code> with a valid proof that the algorithm is correct, <em>because it isn't</em>. As such, we would be able to easily discard that answer, feed the AI an error message, and ask it to try again. We can repeat this process until it gets it right. Of course, this is a simple example, but you could make arbitrarily complex algorithm demands using the same technique. For example, the prompt below would demand a correct sorting algorithm:</p>
<pre><code>Complete the following Agda function:

sort : (in : List Nat) -&gt; Sigma (List Nat) (λ out -&gt; IsSorted out &amp; IsSame in out)
</code></pre>
<p>Once again, chances are it would produce the wrong solution, but we'd be able to automatically discard it and try again, until it gets it right. This leaves us with only the problem (1): <strong>LLMs are notoriously bad at coding</strong>. That is, even if we're able to discard the wrong output, something like current-version ChatGPT will probably never get anything sufficiently complex correct.</p>
<p>Now, that's not unsurprising: GPT wasn't trained to write proofs. As such, a natural solution would be to do so. But the amount of proofs written is very limited, compared to, say, the size of Wikipedia. We don't have enough data. But the cool thing is: we can actually make the AI itself generate the proofs it is trained on. It would work as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Train the AI on publicly available proofs (Agda/Coq std-libs, for example)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Generate a random theorem and ask it to prove</p>
</li>
<li><p>If it gets the proof wrong, go back to 2</p>
</li>
<li><p>If it gets the proof right, train it on that proof, and go back to 1</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By repeating this loop ad infinitum, we'd have both a growing body of proofs, and an AI that is increasingly more capable of proving complex theorems.</p>
<p><strong>My questions are: is there substance to this approach? If so, has anyone tried it? Citations would be appreciated. If not, is there any clear reason I'm not aware of?</strong></p>

(If not chatGPT then in general)","2022-12-13 22:20:38","","2","4997","<natural-language-processing><open-ai><gpt>","<p>I first tried ChatGPT few days ago.  And every day that goes by it seems more and more content filters are introduced.   I can still make it do stuff if I &quot;jailbreak it&quot; but I feel like the restrictions are getting tighter.  By the way I'm not making it do anything bad, just testing it's limits of what it can do.  Over time it can do less and less (or is willing to do less and less).  This makes me wonder how the filters are implemented and why they work the way they do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is it that seemingly for any filter that's put in place there is a workardound?  Things like (imagine, pretend etc).  If something is filtered wouldn't it be filtered across all contexts?   Why does adding a magic word like &quot;act as though&quot; make it ignore filters all of a sudden?</li>
<li>Are the rest of you seeing the same trend of increased filtering?   For me, coming from a sysadmin background it almost feels like a fight between the admins and the users.  The admins begin gently with fine grained filters with very specific contexts, but as they see the onslaught in creativity of the users of bypassing those specific contexts they are using increasingly more and more general contexts to filter on (because they can't keep up with all the jailbreaks).   Of course this blocks legit uses too.</li>
<li>Since ChatGPT is (or more precisely, used to be) very cooperative with what the users told it to behave like, do the admins have a similar natural language interface to interact with chatGPT to tell it how they want it to behave?   Ex admins say &quot;never give a response that's less than 5 sentences in length&quot;, then even though the user says &quot;answer me simply yes or no&quot;.  Admins (hidden) request takes precedence?</li>
<li>Why in a single session I can have it cooperate and then when asked to do exactly the same thing seconds later it refuses? (ex: answer me with a single random swear word: works perfect and then couple questions later it refuses)</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried asking some of these questions to ChatGPT directly and I didn't get very far with it except that apparently the boiler plate &quot;As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I am a machine learning model that ...&quot; is some kind of hard-coded disclaimer added by the engineers.   Supposedly it's a different mechanism from content filters.   Which kind of makes sense.   Of course I don't know if I can trust that answer, as how the disclaimer sais ChatGPT is known to be confidently incorrect.</p>
<p>Also, I realize chatGPT is proprietary, so I'm not expecting anyone to reveal any secrets.  I will be very satisfied of knowing how this is handled in similar NLP models.</p>

<p>The conversation went <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/XDTem.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">like this</a>:</p>

<strong>Mithical</strong>: That's not right. Check carefully and try again.<br />
<strong>ChatGPT</strong>: I apologize if my response was not correct. Can you please provide more information or clarify your question? I may have misunderstood the scenario you described.<br />
<strong>Mithical</strong>: It takes a machine 5 minutes to make a device. How long would it take 100 machines to make 100 devices?<br />
<strong>ChatGPT</strong>: If it takes a single machine 5 minutes to make a single device, then it would take 100 machines 5 minutes to make 100 devices. Therefore, it would take a total of 500 minutes for 100 machines to make 100 devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, unless I'm misunderstanding something here, the answer is 5 minutes. ChatGPT first makes the intuitive mistake of 100, that a human might make as well, and then goes on to (correctly, as far as I understand) say it's 5 minutes... but concludes in the same response that it's then 500 minutes.</p>

<p>However, in light of the recent controversy surrounding ChatGPT's inability to say &quot;I don't know&quot; and its tendency to instead make things up, I couldn't help but wonder:</p>
<p>why not simply train a deep learning algorithm, even as simple as a large ANN, on all the data that ChatGPT was trained on plus a collection of ChatGPT responses manually labelled as accurate or inaccurate?</p>
<p>In fact, one might even imagine a GAN system, with one NN taking a ChatGPT response as input and an improved response/changes to response as output, and the other assessing the veracity of the improved response.</p>
<p>Compared to what ChatGPT is already capable of, to a layman like me, this looks like a trivial task - making sure the input is consistent with the right portion of the training data, or with some comparatively simple patterns within said data, seems infinitely shorter of a task than abstract or original thinking.</p>
<p>So why was such a system not implemented? It's just about the most glaring solution to this problem possible, so there must be something wrong with it if OpenAI still haven't implemented it. Which begs the question: where does it fall apart?</p>

<h2>Q1. Is the above correct?</h2>
<p>I cannot find this stated clearly in the paper, but it is stated explicitly <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AcKRB8wDpdaN6v6ru/interpreting-gpt-the-logit-lens"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.  It's also clearly implied by the parameter count listed <a href=""https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, and argued for as best practice <a href=""https://paperswithcode.com/method/weight-tying"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.  Yet, for example, Karpathy's mini-GPT implementation seems to use two different matrices:</p>
<pre><code>self.tok_emb = nn.Embedding(config.vocab_size, config.n_embd) # &lt;--- This would be E
self.pos_emb = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, config.block_size, config.n_embd))

self.blocks = nn.Sequential(*[Block(config) for _ in range(config.n_layer)])
# decoder head
self.ln_f = nn.LayerNorm(config.n_embd)
self.head = nn.Linear(config.n_embd, config.vocab_size, bias=False) # &lt;--- This has the same dimensions as Etranspose but is clearly a different matrix

<p>This seems to be tasking <span class=""math-container"">$E$</span> with two very different, even opposing, functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Map vocab to their <em>meaning</em> on the input side; higher magnitude indicates &quot;more meaning&quot;</li>
<li>Map meaning to the <em>most likely</em> vocab on the output side; higher magnitude indicates greater likelihood</li>
</ul>
<p>When outputting, we want the softmax to be highest when the word is most likely; magnitude of the output matrix should be roughly proportional to how likely the word is two appear.</p>
<p>Yet, when inputting, magnitude has <em>nothing to do with likelihood</em>.  Magnitude on the input side captures some element of meaning: perhaps how extreme or intense the meaning is, perhaps another aspect (not necessarily easily interpreted).</p>

Each properties as a historic list of tenancies, as well as owners, each tenancies has a list of tenants and rent agreements. Each Owner &amp; Tenant has personal details. And we can go all the way down to financial transactions, invoices against properties.
etc.</p>

<p>I could also write out all details on a per record bases. e.g. &quot;Property 15125 has address '20 W 34th St., New York, NY 10001' with 3 Bedrooms and 2 Bathrooms&quot;. I haven't tried it, but I'm relatively confident that if a dataset becomes sufficiently large (hundreds of records) the system would fail to make the correct connections.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/dthvC.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/dthvC.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>An excerpt from <a href=""https://minimaxir.com/2019/09/howto-gpt2/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this website</a> shows tokens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this case, there are two additional parameters that can be passed
to gpt2.generate(): truncate and include_prefix. For example, if each
short text begins with a &lt;|startoftext|&gt; token and ends with a
&lt;|endoftext|&gt;, then setting prefix='&lt;|startoftext|&gt;',
truncate=&lt;|endoftext|&gt;', and include_prefix=False, and length is
sufficient, then gpt-2-simple will automatically extract the shortform
texts, even when generating in batches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So are the parameters various kinds of tokens that are manually created by humans who try to fine-tune the models? Still, 175 billion such fine-tuning parameters is too high for humans to create, so I assume the &quot;parameters&quot; are auto-generated somehow.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">attention-based</a> paper mentions the <a href=""http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/"" rel=""noreferrer"">query-key-value weight</a> matrices as the &quot;parameters&quot;. <strong>Even if it is these weights, I'd just like to know what kind of a process generates these parameters, who chooses the parameters and specifies the relevance of words? If it's created automatically, how is it done?</strong></p>

<p>When fine-tuning using the 77M model, I keep running into OOM errors, such as:

<p>So far I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using different a optimizer (<code>RMSPropOptimizer</code> instead of <code>AdamOptimizer</code>)</li>
<li>Setting batch-size to 1</li>
<li><code>use_memory_saving_gradients</code></li>
<li><code>only_train_transformer_layers</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Fine-tuning works smoothly on the 355M model.</p>
<p>So what I'm really asking is:</p>
<ul>
<li>is it possible to fine-tune GPT-2's 774M model without industrial-sized hardware?</li>
<li>if so, please tell me about your successful attempts</li>
<li>apart from hardware-recommendations, how could fine-tuning be optimized to make 77M fit in memory?</li>

<p>The current open source implementation of GPT-2 seeks to predict the next word, i.e. the seed text is given ""Scientist have finally"" and the generated text would be "" started being paid enough!""</p>

<p>My first presumption was to use some form of GAN, however it became quickly evident that:</p>

It has recently attracted attention from the general public as the foundation that published the paper, <a href=""https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OpenAI</a>, ironically refused to share the whole model fearing dangerous implications. Along the paper, they also published a manifesto to justify their choice: &quot;Better Language Models and Their Implications&quot;. And soon a lot of media were publishing articles discussing the choice and its effectiveness to actually prevent bad implications. I am not here to discuss the ethical components of this choice but the actual performance of the model.</p>
<p>The model got my attention too and I downloaded the small model to play with. To be honest I am far from impressed by the results. Some times the first paragraph of the produced text appears to make sense, but nine times out of ten it is giberish by the first or the second sentence. Exemples given in the paper seems to be &quot;Lucky&quot; outputs, cherry picked by human hands. Overall, the paper may suffer from a very strong publication bias.</p>

<p>The model appears generally qualified as a &quot;breakthrough&quot;. These writings do not match my personal experimentation as produced texts are rarely consistent / syntactically correct.</p>
