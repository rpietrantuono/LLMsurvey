<p>My task is a follow: I have emails, that represents &quot;price requests&quot; for shipments sends by our clients.
In the emails, the clients tells us the pickup address, the shipper, consignee ETC.</p>
<p>My initial idea was to train different adapters, using DORA, each of them is trained on extracting a different entity from the email.</p>
<p>My dataset was created as follow: I have the email, and the annotation which is &quot;Based on the email, I've found this [ENTITY]: entity_here</p>
<p>I've created a System message, and and chat_template to create the dataset in a way Mistral will accept, using this chat_template:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;{%- for message in messages %}&quot;
  &quot;{%- if message['role'] == 'system' -%}&quot;
      &quot;{{- '&lt;s&gt;' + message['content'] -}}&quot;

<p>Now to the problem. The model seems to learn what it needs to extract, it generates decent answers, with the same format as the assistant it was trained by, the problem is that after it generates the answer, it keeps on generating additional texts regarding the email that are irrelevant to the task, E.G. &quot;please contact us in....&quot;</p>
<p>When I fine tune GPT3.5 for example for the same task, the model is able to extract exactly what I need for it, which suggests to me that I'm doing something wrong.</p>

Since they're just adding random values to the regular parameters?</p>
<p>I also have a somewhat related question if you don't mind answering it as well. I keep reading that the alpha parameter in LoRA is the scaling factor e.g. y = Wx + alpha * L1L2, but I often see alpha values of 256 for example which seems way to large because that would be setting a ratio of 1 : 256 for the influence share between the regular parameters and the LoRA parameters on the output.</p>

Since the dataset is huge, around  50 thousand rows, I was thinking to use stratify sampling on dataset to reduce it to around 2-4 thousand to hyperparameter tune on.
I'm confused between trading off number of trails with size of sample set. Example: Would training 3000 rows with 5 trials will be better than training 1500 rows with 10 trials?
Moreover, thinking if I should drop epoch from tuning and focus on learning rate and weight decay.</p>

However not all models that I want to compare are within one benchmark therefore hard to compare which one is the best.</p>
<p>So I'm reading about each LLM from its base model, how it is continuously pre-trained to see how its objective function looks like. After shortlisting LLMs I'm planning to create my own dataset to compare all LLMs in shortlists.</p>

Replace by datasets Dataset class as input of Trainer train_dataset?","2024-01-21 00:43:54","126509","0","196","<dataset><transformer><huggingface><finetuning><llm>","<h3>Why I try to replace the <code>transformers</code> TextDataset class with <code>datasets</code> Dataset class</h3>
<p>I stumbled upon this when I tried to make the <code>train_dataset</code> of the Transformers Trainer class from a text file, see <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/126382/97556"">How can you get a Huggingface fine-tuning model with the Trainer class from your own text where you can set the arguments for truncation and padding?</a>.</p>
<p>The TextDataset of the transformers package is</p>
<ul>
<li>buggy (next heading) and</li>
<li>outdated (overnext heading).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Transformers TextDataset drops the last block of the split text</h4>
<p>The TextDataset class drops the last block of the text that was split into blocks by means of the <code>block_size</code> parameter, in the following example, <code>512</code> tokens (~ words and other things) per block:</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TextDataset

model_name = &quot;dbmdz/german-gpt2&quot;
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
file_path = './myfile.txt'

train_dataset = TextDataset(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    file_path=file_path,
    block_size=512,
    overwrite_cache=True,
)
</code></pre>
<p>If I check the last block, I see that it cuts the very last block that has the tail of the text. This code shows only the second last block, the last block gets dropped by the TextDataset class:</p>
<p><code>tokenizer.decode(train_dataset['input_ids'][-1])</code></p>
<p>Instead, the Trainer class does not drop the last batch by default, but you see from this that there is such a parameter also for the Auto dataloader arguments of the Trainer class, see <a href=""https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Seq2SeqTrainingArguments.dataloader_drop_last"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">class transformers Training Arguments</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dataloader_drop_last (bool, optional, defaults to False) — Whether to drop the last incomplete batch (if the length of the dataset is not divisible by the batch size) or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Transformers TextDataset is outdated</h4>
<p>When I change the setting of a tokenizer and build the TextDataset object another time, sometimes a warning shows that you should take the Transformers datasets Dataset class instead.</p>
<p>Here is the warning (there are two warnings in it):</p>
<p>Warning 1:</p>
<pre class=""lang-shell prettyprint-override""><code>&gt; /srv/home/my_user/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/data/datasets/language_modeling.py:54:
&gt; FutureWarning: This dataset will be removed from the library soon,
&gt; preprocessing should be handled with the 🤗 Datasets library. You can
&gt; have a look at this example script for pointers:
&gt; https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling/run_mlm.py
</code></pre>
<p>Warning 2:</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>&gt; warnings.warn( Token indices sequence length is longer than the
&gt; specified maximum sequence length for this model (31482 &gt; 512).
&gt; Running this sequence through the model will result in indexing errors
</code></pre>
<p>Warning 2 is just from changing from one tokenizer to another, it comes from <a href=""https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/3f69f415adcbdaedec154ba8eac220ef3276975d/examples/pytorch/language-modeling/run_mlm.py#L466C1-L470C14"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this line in the given link of the warning</a>.</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>        if data_args.max_seq_length &gt; tokenizer.model_max_length:
            logger.warning(
                f&quot;The max_seq_length passed ({data_args.max_seq_length}) is larger than the maximum length for the &quot;

            )
</code></pre>
<p>It is enough to run the code again to get rid of warning 2. This question is only about warning 1 (&quot;FutureWarning: This dataset will be removed...&quot;).</p>
<h3>Question</h3>
<p>How do I replace the <code>transformers</code> Textdataset class with the <code>datasets</code> Dataset class so that the output is a dataset that can be the argument of the <code>train_dataset</code> parameter of the <code>transformers</code> Trainer class?</p>

Please use examples related to potential monopsonies in the labour market and cite relevant research.### Assistant: &quot;Monopsony&quot; refers to a market structure where there is only one buyer for a particular good or service. In economics, this term is particularly relevant in the labor market, where a monopsony employer has significant power over the wages and working conditions of their employees. The presence of a monopsony can result in lower wages and reduced employment opportunities for workers, as the employer has little incentive to increase wages or provide better working conditions. Recent research has identified potential monopsonies in industries such as retail and fast food, where a few large companies control a significant portion of the market (Bivens &amp; Mishel, 2013). In these industries, workers often face low wages, limited benefits, and reduced bargaining power, leading to a situation where they are dependent on the employer for their livelihood. This dependence can result in further suppression of wages and a decline in working conditions. Overall, the concept of monopsony is essential to understanding the dynamics of labor markets and the impact of market power on workers. Further research is needed to understand the extent and impact of monopsonies on the economy and to develop policies to address this issue. References: Bivens, J., &amp; Mishel, L. (2013).

<p>All of this coding runs in circles when I ask ChatGPT 3.5 for help (I did not test a higher version). It will begin to subclass classes like <code>class MyTrainer(Trainer)</code> or <code>class MyDataCollator(DataCollatorForLanguageModeling)</code> and tries new functions like <code>collate_function(batch, tokenizer)</code> or overrides or overloads methods. After trying this for hours, I do not get to any code where I can just set the truncation, to begin with, let alone the padding, <em>and</em> get a working fine-tuned text generation model from this tokenized short input text.</p>
<p>How should I code a Huggingface fine-tuning model with the Trainer class where I can set the arguments for the truncation and padding parameters to tokenize my own short input text and where afterwards <code>trainer.train()</code> runs through?</p>
<h4>PS: why I ask</h4>
<p>I want to know this since I feed a text generation fine-tuning model with a short essay and ask it questions (even if it is not a Question Answering model). I do this since a Question Answering model is only cutting pieces from the text, there is no free speech, and even though the answers are not bad either, they are not as if a human being would make judgements, it is more a fishing for some keywords and their embedding. In short, the output is not good, I already tried a lot of hyperparameters. I do not split the text into sentences but load the whole text as one so-called &quot;example&quot; of the dataset. I do not know whether this is good, I just hope that the model understands the text better if it is one full text in one &quot;example&quot;.</p>
<p>I ask it questions regarding the whole text, not just some split sentences. Therefore, I want to make sure that the tokenizer works such that the whole text is read and tokenized without dropping any text. To check this, I want to change truncation from the default <code>False</code> to <code>True</code> only to see whether the output is worse. If it is not worse, I would know that it gets truncated to the max_length of the model. In short, I want to find out with this question here whether I need to change the code and split the text into many examples or not, but I also want to play around with the parameters and want to know whether truncation plays any role for the output at all.</p>

<pre class=""lang-shell prettyprint-override""><code>1000000000000000019884624838656
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that the <code>max_length</code> is so utterly large that I doubt any full document will ever reach it - and this is just the length of each example, row by row, in the dataset. I guess that truncation does not play a role at all anymore if such a large <code>max_length</code> is set. &quot;Set the truncation parameter to True to truncate a sequence to the maximum length accepted by the model&quot; is what the Huggingface guide says about truncation, see <a href=""https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/preprocessing#truncation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Truncation</a>.</p>
<p>That does not sound as if I ever can truncate the text or ever wanted to since that would lead to a worse understanding of the text. And that seems right since <a href=""https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/pad_truncation#padding-and-truncation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Padding and truncation</a> shows that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>False</code> or 'do_not_truncate': no truncation is applied. This is the default behavior.<br />
...<br />
<code>False</code> or 'do_not_pad': no padding is applied. This is the default behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The default for truncation is <code>False</code> anyway, why should I care about truncation? Should I care at all? If the <code>tokenizer.max_length</code> is so very very large, is truncation not just never happening anyway? Will the change to <code>True</code> change the output of the model or not?</p>

<p>In classification, I usually calculate the loss and other metrics (e.g   accuracy) on a validation set to for early stopping and to save the checkpoint of the best epoch, but for Text Generation tasks I see these additional issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(Causal) text generation is <em>slow</em>, while training can be more parallelized with teacher forcing. <em>Does it make sense to perform validation and generate text after every training epoch?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Text generation depends on an additional set of hyperparameters which greatly condition the quality of generated text, such as the <a href=""https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">decoding technique</a> (greedy vs sampling-based or other techniques), number of beams, temperature, maximum length, etc. All these parameters are not actually used during training. <em>I suppose  also find the best combination <em>after</em> training, but how can I monitor the training?</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>HuggingFace <a href=""https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/text_generation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">generation API</a> does not provide the loss during prediction, i.e I cannot generate text and calculate the cross-entropy loss (at least out-of-the-box) during validation. To calculate loss I could either</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a custom generation procedure which includes loss.</li>
<li>Perform two passes on all data during validation (one with <code>model.generate</code> and one with <code>model.forward</code> )</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Both these alternatives are suboptimal and this made me think that it is not common to calculate validation loss in text generation tasks, is it true?</em></p>

Part of this experiment involves fine-tuning the models on a made-up new word in a specific sentential context and observing its predictions for that novel word in other contexts post-tuning. Because I am just trying to teach it a new word, we freeze the embeddings for the other words during fine-tuning so that only the weights for the new word are updated. This means that I would like for everything to be treated as if it were &quot;normal,&quot; except for adding the new word to the model's vocabulary.</p>
<p>I've added the new word to the model and tokenizer like in this MWE (in the case of BERT):</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForMaskedLM
new_words = ['myword1', 'myword2']
model = BertForMaskedLM.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', do_basic_tokenize = False)
tokenizer.tokenize('myword1 myword2') 
# verify the words do not already exist in the vocabulary
# result: ['my', '##word', '##1', 'my', '##word', '##2']

new_tokenizer.tokenize('the period is a subword.')
# result: ['the', 'period', 'is', 'a', 'sub', '##word', '##.']
    
tokenizer.tokenize('but not when it follows myword1.')
# result: ['but', 'not', 'when', 'it', 'follows', 'myword1', '.']
</code></pre>
<p>How can I add a new token and have it behave correctly (i.e., by preserving the correct subword tokenization of adjacent strings)? Similar issues happen with RoBERTa, where the following word does not appear to be tokenized correctly (it is tokenized without the 'Ġ' that indicates a preceding space, which is present when the new word is replaced with an existing token). (This Ġ is also not present on the added token, but I assume that as long as the added token never occurs at the beginning of a string, it wouldn't matter.)</p>
<p>Edit:
After poking around a bit more, I've found that this is related to my setting <code>do_basic_tokenize=False</code>. If it is not set to false, the results come out as expected. Nevertheless, I'd prefer to keep that set to false if there's a way to fix this.</p>

<p>More specifically, I train each epoch by optimizing binary cross entropy per class, taking the mean, and then run back propagation to optimize the parameters. At the end of each epoch, I then compute the soft-f1 score on the validation set, and then save that model only if the score has improved. The predicted class is chosen by taking an argmax, so there is no threshold.</p>
<p>There are a few observations here, some of which are troubling:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If I simply use log-loss as the criteria for choosing the best model, then the model will typically only train for 3-4 epochs before the losses start to degrade. This is the standard approach, and gives descent f1 scores across the training/validation and test sets.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If I instead use the soft-f1 criteria as specified above, the model will typically train for <em>15</em> epochs (where I use a stopping condition of 5 epochs if there is no improvement). The f1 scores are significantly better on the training set, and marginally better on the validation and test sets. I'm guessing that the improvement on the training set is simply due to overfitting, as the model has run substantially longer. But then there are also improvements in the validation and test sets too. The log-loss for this second model is (naturally) worse than model #1.</p>
</li>

<p>My incoming text has already been split into words. When tokenizing during training/fine-tuning I can use <code>tokenizer(text,is_split_into_words=True)</code> to tokenize the incoming text. However, I can't figure out how to do the same in a <code>pipeline</code> for predictions.</p>

<p>I'm looking to get up to speed with some of the newer ML classification techniques and keep my ML python fresh in my spare time/learn some new skills, so as a challenge I'm trying to see if I can beat some of the budgeting apps with their classification (and make the tagging a bit more personal). I use Mint and have easy access to my own banking data so have a good way to benchmark this little project. Data is &lt; 100 characters, unstructured (I'm not going to share my personal data as thats all I have at the moment, but to give an idea of the structure I'm using have a look at your csv bank statement!).</p>
<p>Ideally I'd love to have way to tag a couple of &quot;levels&quot; e.g. Restaurants and Eating Out : Coffee shop with the merchant name e.g. Starbucks cleansed too.</p>
<p>Context:</p>
<p>I work in Python, familiar with Tensorflow (but use more for gradient descent type optimizations in my day to day work). I haven't done any NLP in over 10 years. Back then I used Naive Bayes classifier which took some heavy lift... things have come on A LOT since then.</p>
<p>So few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What are the current tools people use for this type of exercise. I've read about spaCy, huggingface - are these the main tools used? What are the pros cons to each if so? (without sounding too old... there is so much off the shelf nowadays since I last looked at this space... props to the open source community!!!)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Any other tools I should be considering?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Any good articles people have read where people have tried to implement this problem? Any good online resources tackling this?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Any gotchas I should watch out for?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Any public large datasets anyone is aware of I could use?</p>
</li>
<li><p>And also I plan to do this in Python, because that's what I'm familiar with, but if people are tackling this in a different language I'd love to hear which and why (and maybe I'll give it a spin).</p>

<p>Where my loss function is:-</p>
<p><code>loss = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)</code></p>
<p>The learning rate is calculated like so:-</p>
<pre><code>lr_scheduler = PolynomialDecay(
    initial_learning_rate=5e-5,
    end_learning_rate=0.,
    decay_steps=num_train_steps
    )

num_epochs = 3

num_train_steps = (len(encoded_train['input_ids']) // batch_size) * num_epochs

<p>Which gives:-</p>
<pre><code>Any NaN in y_train?  False
Any NaN in y_val?  False
</code></pre>
<p>I also tried:-</p>
<pre><code>print(&quot;Any NaN in encoded_train['input_ids']? &quot;,np.isnan(np.array(encoded_train['input_ids'])).any())
print(&quot;Any NaN 'encoded_train['attention_mask']'? &quot;,np.isnan(np.array(encoded_train['attention_mask'])).any())
</code></pre>
<p>but only got:-</p>
<pre><code>Any NaN in encoded_train['input_ids']?  False
Any NaN 'encoded_train['attention_mask']'?  False
</code></pre>
<p>I am struggling to know where to go next with this code.</p>
<p>The full error trace looks like this, you can see the accuracy and loss on each epoch and this model is obviously not training at all:-</p>
<pre><code>Some layers from the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-cased were not used when initializing TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification: ['vocab_layer_norm', 'vocab_projector', 'activation_13', 'vocab_transform']
- This IS expected if you are initializing TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some layers of TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-cased and are newly initialized: ['pre_classifier', 'classifier', 'dropout_59']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Unfortunately, the official tutorial doesn't meet my needs, for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>nn.TransformerDecoder is not used in the example.</li>
<li>The example is about language modeling, not text generation. There is no forward loop that generates text word by word.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've searched around the web and I've found a few things, but nothing like a simple and minimal working example that directly applies to my problem setting. Concretely, on the output side of things I need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to generate output sequences in batch. I've found codes on GitHub where people appear to be doing text generation, but they do it for a single sequence at a time, not a batch of multiple sequences.</li>
<li>The output sequences may have different lengths.</li>
<li>I want to train my model with the teacher-forcing strategy and batches of multiple sequences. Given that in training I know the lengths of the sequences in advance, you may assume that I already have my batches padded with zeroes. However, I still need to figure out how to implement the forward function of my model, with a generation loop that uses nn.TransformerDecoder. Basically, I need to figure out how to iterate word-wise over my batch of output sequences, masking out the future words in each step (so that the model doesn't cheat by trivially predicting the next words).</li>
<li>Then, I need a similar forward function for inference mode. I need to figure out how to implement the generation loop to do basically the same as in training mode, except that instead of teacher-forcing I want to implement greedy search (i.e. use the tokens with highest predicted probability at iteration i as the next input for iteration i+1).</li>
</ul>
<p>I already know how to do all this using LSTMs. Below you can see the forward function of a model that I implemented in the past to do exactly what I just said with an LSTM. The same forward function is used for both training and inference, depending on the value of the variable 'mode':</p>
<pre><code>  def forward(
      self,
      image_local_features,
      question_vectors,
      answers=None,
      max_answer_length=None,
      mode='train',
  ):
    if mode == 'train':
      batch_size, max_answer_length = answers.shape
      assert answers is not None
    else:
      batch_size = image_local_features.size(0)
      assert max_answer_length is not None
    
    y = self.embedding_table(self.start_idx).expand(batch_size, -1)
    o = torch.zeros(batch_size, self.hidden_size).to(DEVICE)
    h = self.W_h(question_vectors)
    c = self.W_c(question_vectors)

    if mode == 'train':
      answer_embeddings = self.embedding_table(answers.permute(1,0))
      assert answer_embeddings.shape == (max_answer_length, batch_size, self.embed_size)

    output = []

    for t in range(max_answer_length):
      y_bar = torch.cat((y,o),1)
      assert y_bar.shape == (batch_size, self.embed_size + self.hidden_size)
      assert h.shape == (batch_size, self.hidden_size)
      assert c.shape == (batch_size, self.hidden_size)
      h, c = self.lstm_cell(y_bar, (h, c))
      e = (self.W_attn(image_local_features) * h.unsqueeze(1)).sum(-1)
      att = torch.softmax(e,-1)
      a = (image_local_features * att.unsqueeze(2)).sum(1)
      assert a.shape == (batch_size, self.image_local_feat_size)
      u = torch.cat((a,h),1)
      assert u.shape == (batch_size, self.hidden_size + self.image_local_feat_size)
      v = self.W_u(u)
      o = self.dropout(torch.tanh(v))
      assert o.shape == (batch_size, self.hidden_size)
      output.append(self.W_vocab(o))
      if mode == 'train':
        y = answer_embeddings[t] # teacher-forcing
      else:
        y = self.embedding_table(torch.argmax(output[t], 1)) # greedy search
      assert y.shape == (batch_size, self.embed_size)

    output = torch.stack(output, 1)
    assert output.shape == (batch_size, max_answer_length, self.vocab_size)
    return output
</code></pre>
<p>Another way to phrase my question would be: how can I reimplement what I did with LSTMs using nn.TransformerDecoder instead?</p>
<p>Any minimal working / <em>hello world</em> example that shows how to do batch training and batch inference with nn.TransformerDecoder for text generation will be very appreciated.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Note</em>: alternatively, if there is a straightforward way of accomplishing the same with an out-of-the-box solution from <a href=""https://huggingface.co/transformers/"" rel=""noreferrer"">hugginface</a>, that would be awesome too.</p>

<p>During training, I use linear LR warmup schedule with max LR=<code>5-e5</code> and <em>cross entropy loss</em>.
In general, the model is able to learn on my dataset and reach high precision/recall metrics.</p>

<p><strong>My question is:</strong></p>

<p>Should weights distributions and biases in <em>classification</em> layers change more during training? It seems like the weights almost do not change at all, even when I do not initialize them as in the code (to mean=<code>0.0</code> and std=<code>0.02</code>). Is this an indication that something is wrong with my model or it's just because the layers I've added are redundant and model does not learn nothing new?</p>

<p>Take look at the image of weight from the tensorboard:

<p>In Above code pooled_output is considered useful in line  <code>_, pooled_output = self.bert(input_ids, token_type_ids, attention_mask, output_all_encoded_layers=False)</code>  </p>

<p>And in below QnA code encoder layer output (i.e., sequence_output) is considered useful in line: <code>sequence_output, _ = self.bert(input_ids, token_type_ids, attention_mask, output_all_encoded_layers=False)</code></p>

<pre><code>class BertForQuestionAnswering(PreTrainedBertModel):

<li><p>What is different in encoder layer and pooled layer </p></li>
<li><p>Why is encoder layer (sequence_output) is considered in QnA case and Pooled layer in classification case</p></li>
