"78826190","How to use Azure OpenAI APIs to programmatically provide editorial review for my MD web pages","2024-08-02 15:21:01","","0","42","<azure><azure-openai><gpt-3>","<p>I have a few Jekyll websites for smaller open source projects, and wanted to write a local Node.js script, that leverages Azure OpenAI to effectively provide editorial updates to the contents of my web pages (as MD files).</p>
<p>What i want, is to defined prompts for various content elements of the pag that describe what i want done to them (ex psuedo prompt: Here is the page title, optimize for SEO, and limit to 60 characters: &quot;Learn how to get started with development on X&quot;. only return the updated title and nothing else.).</p>
<p>I've done this, and sent them off to Azure OpeAI APIs, using the gpt-350-turbo model and the Azure completions API, and I get responses that are close, but they have random &quot;junk&quot; content in there as well (even tho i explicitly specify NOT to in the prompt).</p>
<p>For example, i might get back someting like:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;choices&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Example response (correct):\Get started developing your solution using X\n\n\n\nFor the given&quot;,
      &quot;index&quot;: 0,
      &quot;finish_reason&quot;: &quot;length&quot;,
      &quot;logprobs&quot;: null
    }
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it puts &quot;junk&quot; like <code>Example response (correct):\</code> in front and sometimes weird characters or fragments of &quot;further responses&quot; (like <code>For the given</code>) below.</p>
<p>I assume i'm overlooking something simple; Am i using the wrong model? Is gpt too conversational for simple prompt -&gt; direct output? Is completions the right API?</p>

Do step-by-step:

1. Remove from the &quot;employees&quot; list above each employee if any time interval in 
&quot;busy_date_time&quot; list overlaps with &quot;required_date_time&quot;.

2. If the number of employees left in the &quot;employees&quot; list is less than 
&quot;required_employees_number&quot;, set the new value to &quot;required_employees_number&quot; equal 
to the number of employees left in the &quot;employees&quot; list.

3. Select &quot;required_employees_number&quot; employees with &quot;required_experience&quot; and lower 
&quot;interviews_conducted&quot; value. You shouldn't find the one with the lowest 
&quot;interviews_conducted&quot; value among all, but a required number of employees which is 
&quot;required_employees_number&quot;.

4. Check the previous step where you usually make the mistake of selecting 1 employee
with minimum &quot;interviews_conducted&quot; value among all employees when you need to select 
a list of &quot;required_employees_number&quot; employees.

required_date_time = '''{&quot;start_time&quot;: &quot;February 10 2024 10:00&quot;, &quot;end_time&quot;: &quot;February 10 2024 11:00&quot;}'''
required_employees_number = 1
required_experience = &quot;middle&quot;

<p>When I tried debugging it I got told I don’t initialise the function properly. However that is not the case. And I also tried changing the way I initialise it so many time. I am using this to call it: <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai</a> (it is the version 4.26.0), so I should initialise it this way.</p>
<p>If nobody can help me maybe you can recommend me what other ai to use, because at this point I am suspecting it might be just an issue with OpenAI api.</p>

Is there any workaround? Can not we go beyond the limitation of the current function call method of GPT model?</p>

I have been trying to use GPT to achieve this using a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) model with the help of semantic search. However, I have noticed that the primitive chatbot I developed can answer questions such as &quot;Did I receive an email from X&quot; or &quot;Do I have any payments due?&quot; but often retrieves emails from a long time ago. The problem is that when I modify the question to state &quot;Did I receive an email from X in the past week?&quot;, it can't retrieve the right emails because the embeddings I used do not understand &quot;in the past week&quot; even if I provide the current date in the query. In order to fix this and a few other problems, I want to implement a two layered system where I put all my emails in a SQL database with their message-ids, to, and from etc, choose the relevant emails from the database and then run semantic search on those to provide the final answer.</p>
<p>Now, my idea is to define two functions: one to generate a SQL query and retrieve emails from the database, and the other to run semantic search. I want to input these as functions to the GPT module and let it decide when it wants to call either function.</p>
<p>For example, if the question was &quot;How many emails did I receive in the past week?&quot;, all it has to do is run the SQL function. If the question was &quot;Did my credit card get approved?&quot;, it only needs to run a semantic search. However, for complex queries such as &quot;Summarize all important emails from the past week&quot;, it first needs to run the SQL function, then semantic search for &quot;important&quot;, and summarize. I am not sure how GPT can break it down into &quot;retrieve emails from SQL database for the past week&quot; and &quot;Run semantic search to look for important emails&quot;.</p>
<p>I have tried running test runs with chat gpt with a prompt along the lines of &quot;If you can't answer the question based on the given columns and their descriptions in the table, return the entire table&quot; to see if it can figure out when to run a SQL query and when not to. But the results aren't great. And I imagine this would be even harder when all of this is integrated and it has to figure out that it needs to do things sequentially. Any help is appreciated.</p>

You tried to access openai.Completion, but this is no longer supported in openai&gt;=1.0.0 - see the README at https://github.com/openai/openai-python for the API.

You can run `openai migrate` to automatically upgrade your codebase to use the 1.0.0 interface. 

Alternatively, you can pin your installation to the old version, e.g. `pip install openai==0.28`

<p>The script reads strings from a spreadsheet, processes them, and sends them to the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model for text completion. Here's a simplified version of the setup:</p>

<p>The issue occurs intermittently. The terminal prints &quot;Sending API request...&quot; but then hangs indefinitely without printing &quot;API request complete.&quot; or raising any exception. Initially, I thought it was a delay, but even after waiting for 20 minutes, the hang persists. Notably, pressing <code>Ctrl+C</code> doesn’t terminate the script, and I have to kill the terminal to stop it. This hang happens on different strings and after a varying number of API calls.</p>
<p>I implemented a <code>TimeoutTracer</code> class to set a timeout using <code>sys.settrace</code>, hoping to interrupt the hang and gather more information.</p>
<pre><code>

        if time.time() - self.start &gt; self.TOTAL_TIMEOUT:
            logger.error(f&quot;{'#'*20} ERROR {'#'*20}&quot;)
            logger.error(f&quot;Timeout of {self.TOTAL_TIMEOUT} seconds exceeded!&quot;)
            raise Exception('Timed out!')
        return self.trace_function

        # ...

    def use_gpt(self, string_to_be_processed):
        payload = self._build_gpt_payload(string_to_be_processed)
        TOTAL_TIMEOUT = 60
        start = time.time()
        tracer = TimeoutTracer(start, TOTAL_TIMEOUT)
        sys.settrace(tracer.trace_function)
        try:
            print(&quot;Sending API request...&quot;)

            return &quot;{}&quot;
        finally:
            sys.settrace(None)  # Remove the time constraint and continue normally.
        # ... (process gpt_response)

# ... (rest of the script including loading strings and processing loop)

</code></pre>
<p>I had a log output for every time <code>sys.settrace</code> was called and found that when it hangs, <code>sys.settrace</code> stops being called, which suggests that no code is being executed during these hang periods. This might also explain why <code>Ctrl+C</code> isn’t working. Additionally, I am not hitting any rate limits as OpenAI would return a message in that case.</p>
<p>I am looking for insights or suggestions on what could be causing this hang and how to resolve or debug it further. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Result:
<em>User: who was the first person on the moon?
GPT: The first person to step foot on the moon was Neil Armstrong, an American astronaut, on July 20, 1969, as part of NASA's Apollo 11 mission.
User: how tall is he?
GPT: Neil Armstrong was approximately 5 feet 11 inches (180 cm) tall.</em></p>
<p>But it requires tons of tokens. And I've heard that GPT-4 differs from GPT-3 in that it's able to remember the previous messages (on its own). Is that correct?</p>
<p>But if I remove the line where I append the 'messages' list with the latest one and send only one message:
<code>completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create( model=&quot;gpt-4&quot;, messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: content}] )</code>
it can't remember anything.</p>
<p><em>User: who was the first person on the moon?
GPT: The first person on the moon was Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969.
User: how tall is he?
GPT: Without specific context or information about who &quot;he&quot; refers to, I'm unable to provide an accurate answer.</em></p>
<p>So I'm wondering is there any workflow difference between GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4?</p>

"76934155","How to improve API response time for AI-powered web application with OpenAI GPT Chat Completion?","2023-08-19 08:10:42","","0","315","<python><http><flask><openai-api><gpt-3>","<p><strong>Preface:</strong>
We have developed an AI-powered web application with the goal of processing scanned student certificates and grade transcripts. These documents are uploaded to a NoSQL database (specifically MongoDB). We use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for data extraction, then employ OpenAI LLM Models to convert the extracted information to JSON. Additionally, we leverage AI for translating the JSON content into English.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong>
During the use of OpenAI GPT Chat Completion, there are occasional delays in response time, sometimes exceeding 30 seconds. This occurs approximately 70% of the time during the translation phase of the JSON object and 30% during the conversion phase from a string to JSON.</p>
<p>We analyzed and adopted the [gpt-3.5-turbo-0301] model to mitigate this issue due to its faster response time while yielding the exact expected output.</p>
<p>Our Python Flask Application features 8 API endpoints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initialization: &quot;/api/v1/initialize&quot; [0.5-3 seconds].</li>
<li>Text Extraction: &quot;/api/v1/extract-text&quot; [4-15 seconds].</li>
<li>Table Extraction: &quot;/api/v1/extract-tables&quot; [8-20 seconds].</li>
<li>Text Correction: &quot;/api/v1/correct-text&quot; [2-20 seconds].</li>
<li>Table Correction: &quot;/api/v1/correct-tables&quot; [13-30+ seconds].</li>
<li>Text Translation: &quot;/api/v1/translate-text&quot; [2-20 seconds].</li>
<li>Table Translation: &quot;/api/v1/translate-tables&quot; [13-30+ seconds].</li>
<li>Document Generation: &quot;/api/v1/generate-document&quot; [5-10 seconds].</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, the issue is concentrated on two endpoints: &quot;/api/v1/correct-tables&quot; and &quot;/api/v1/translate-tables&quot;.</p>
<p>As our client side is developed with Next.js, communication with the server is solely through HTTP. It's important to note that we are constrained by Heroku's requested timeout limit of 30 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed solutions (yet not confirmed for implementation):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Enhance the client-side logic to handle process failures without triggering timeout errors. Failed processes would initiate a 5-second waiting period followed by automatic reattempting until success.</li>
<li>Explore the possibility of switching to a different GPT provider due to perceived intentional slowdowns in OpenAI's API responses. However, this alternative may not guarantee a solution and require further evaluation.</li>
</ol>

article &lt;- 'In der Adventzeit rücken Armut, Flucht, Krankheit und Obdachlosigkeit vermehrt in den Fokus der Öffentlichkeit. Nicht nur in der Weihnachtsgeschichte geht es um Armut, Flucht, Krankheit und Obdachlosigkeit. Im Advent rücken diese Themen wiederholt in das Blickfeld der Öffentlichkeit, denn für viele Familien ist Weihnachten aus finanziellen und gesundheitlichen Gründen keine besinnliche Zeit. Rund 140.000 Menschen in Österreich könnten ihre Wohnung nicht ausreichend heizen. Das sagte Caritas-Präsident Michael Landau am Sonntagvormittag in der ORF-&quot;Pressestunde&quot;. Das Ziel der neuen Regierung müsse sein, Kinderarmut und Altersarmut zu senken. Landau hatte der türkis-blauen Regierung während der vergangenen Legislaturperiode eine &quot;Demontage&quot; des Sozialstaats vorgeworfen. Im ORF-Studio betonte er wiederholt seine &quot;Erleichterung&quot; über den Entscheid des Verfassungsgerichtshofs, die Kernpunkte der neuen Sozialhilfe von Türkis-Blau zu kippen. Die Höchstrichter hatten am Dienstag sowohl die starken Kürzungen für kinderreiche Familien als auch für Menschen mit schlechten Deutsch- oder Englischkenntnissen gekippt. &quot;Die Mindestsicherung muss Armut vermeiden&quot;, sagte Landau. Eine Kürzung der Familienzuschläge auf 44 Euro ab dem dritten Kind – wie in der neuen Sozialhilfe von Türkis-Blau vorgesehen – &quot;entspricht nicht der Lebenswirklichkeit von Menschen&quot;. Alleinerzieherinnen und kinderreiche, einkommensschwache Familien seien sowieso schon &quot;in besonderer Weise armutsgefährdet&quot;. Die VfGH-Entscheidung sei eine Chance, Landau plädiert für eine Neuregelung unter Einbindung der Praktiker und Hilfsorganisationen. Auch im Pflegebereich brauche man dringend neue Lösungen. Die vorige Bundesregierung habe völlig zu Recht erkannt, dass dieses Thema viele Menschen berühre. Österreich ist pflegebedürftig, so Landau – er hoffe auf die neue Regierung, egal wie sie aussehe. Es brauche einen vergleichbaren Qualitäts-, Versorgungs- und Finanzierungsrahmen. Der Zugang zur Pflege müsse für alle flächendeckend leistbar sein und es brauche auch Anstrengungen, damit sich Menschen für den Pflegeberuf entscheiden. Die Zahl der pflegebedürftigen Menschen in Österreich ist gestiegen, damit haben sich laut Statistik Austria auch die Kosten für die Betreuung kräftig erhöht. Die Pflegekosten des Staats sind seit 2013 um ein Drittel angestiegen, zeigen aktuelle Zahlen. 13.000 Menschen mehr als im Vorjahr waren in Heimen und Pflegehäusern untergebracht. Bei den Hausbesuchen durch Pflegefachkräfte war der Anstieg geringer. Neben dem Plus der älteren, pflegebedürftigen Menschen habe sich aber auch die Abschaffung des Pflegeregress ausgewirkt. Sozialministerin Brigitte Zarfl hatte im November zwei Studien zur Zukunft der Pflege in Österreich präsentiert. Die Zahlen deuteten auf einen bevorstehenden Personalmangel hin. (red, 22.12.2019)'

<p>I’m trying to create an Android app in Kotlin (with Android Studio Flamingo) that uses one of OpenAI’s language models. OpenAI’s <a href=""https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation</a>, obviously, says that for production apps, all API calls should be routed through a backend server (where, I guess, the key can be set as an environment variable) to avoid exposing the API  key in the app’s code. I’m planning to use one of the pre-build backend services such AWS, Back4App or Firebase to store the necessary data for my app. However I’m not sure how to use those, if it is even possible, to route API requests from the app to OpenAI - that is what scripts would I have to run on the server, how to modify the code making the request in the app etc.</p>
<p>I was planning to use the open source OpenAI Kotlin library from here for the code that would run inside the app: <a href=""https://github.com/Aallam/openai-kotlin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/Aallam/openai-kotlin</a></p>

I tried many other methods but didn't succeed so now I thought I should try OpenAI's function calling.</p>
<p>What I did:
I created a function for one of the view. In that, I am calling GPT3 to create a SQL query based on the user question that I provide in the parameter. I have given instructions and schema to the model so it can create correct query. Below is the function.</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>def get_rent_details(user_query):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Get the current weather in a given location&quot;&quot;&quot;

        model=&quot;gpt-3.5-turbo-0613&quot;,
        prompt=&quot;&quot;&quot;User will ask you the question regarding their properties, assets and finance. 

        Follow below steps to get correct answer:

        1. Understand the user question and prepare a syntactically correct SQL query to retrieve the correct data.
        2. If you don't find the data in the table, just type &quot;No answer found&quot;.
        3. Do not make up any answer by your own.
        4. Instead of '=', always use 'LIKE' statement with 'WHERE' statement.
        5. The user will mention either property name or tenant name. So to make sure the query is correct, use both columns 'TenantName' and 'PropertyName' with 'WHERE' statement. For example: SELECT PropertyCode FROM viewRentRoll WHERE PropertyName LIKE 'Younger, 3003' OR TenantName LIKE 'Younger, 3003'.
        6. DO NOT create any DML query like UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, ADD.
        7. Below is the table schema to run query on:

        CREATE TABLE [dbo].[viewRentRoll] (            
       [PropertyPKId] [bigint]

<pre><code>Give 10 Examples of pizza ingredients: 
1. tomatoes
2. mushrooms
</code></pre>
<p>The text-davinci-003 model completes the list as expected and stops but the gpt-3.5-turbo model generates tokens until the token limit is reached, even when I tell the model to stop when the task is done. Using few shot prompting also doesn't seem to work here.</p>
<p>Hacky workarounds</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Using a low value for max_tokens. But it is hard to estimate the value because parts of the prompt will be changed dynamically in the application. And it still needs postprocessing to remove wasted tokens.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Put a counter before the examples and then using a specific number as stop sequence. When using a general counter like above then I need to ensure that the stop sequence won't be generated accidentally so that the model stops. When using an unusual counter like &quot;1~~&quot;, &quot;2~~&quot;... there is a chance that the model malforms the stop sequence so that it still will be generating until the limit is reached.</p>

I found a quickstart example on the web:</p>
<pre><code>def generate_chat_completion(messages, model=&quot;gpt-3.5-turbo&quot;, temperature=1, max_tokens=None):
    headers = {
        &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;,
        &quot;Authorization&quot;: f&quot;Bearer {API_KEY}&quot;,
    }

    data = {
        &quot;model&quot;: model,
        &quot;messages&quot;: messages,
        &quot;temperature&quot;: temperature,
    }

    max_tokens = 100

    if max_tokens is not None:
        data[&quot;max_tokens&quot;] = max_tokens

    response = requests.post(API_ENDPOINT, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))

    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()[&quot;choices&quot;][0][&quot;message&quot;][&quot;content&quot;]
    else:
        raise Exception(f&quot;Error {response.status_code}: {response.text}&quot;)

while 1:
    inputText = input(&quot;Enter your message: &quot;)

    messages = [
        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: inputText},
    ]

    response_text = generate_chat_completion(messages)
    print(response_text)
</code></pre>
<p>With the necessary imports and the API key and endpoint defined above the code block. I added the inputText variable to take text inputs and an infinite <em>while</em> loop to keep the input/response cycle going until the program is terminated (probably bad practice).</p>
<p>However, I've noticed that responses from the API aren't able to reference previous parts of the conversation like the ChatGPT web application (rightfully so, as I have not mentioned any form of conversation object). I looked up on the API documentation on chat completion and the conversation request example is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>[
  {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French.&quot;},
  {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: 'Translate the following English text to French: &quot;{text}&quot;'}
]
</code></pre>
<p>However, this means I will have to send all the inputted messages into the conversation at once and get a response back for each of them. I cannot seem to find a way (at least as described in the API) to send a message, then get one back, and then send another message in the format of a full conversation with reference to previous messages like a chatbot (or as described before the ChatGPT app). Is there some way to implement this?</p>
<p>Also: the above does not use the OpenAI Python module. It uses the <a href=""https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Requests</a> and JSON modules.</p>

        metrics_result += f'Average price of products: (avg_price)'
        for index, row in df.iterrows():
            metrics_result += f'Product ID: (row[&quot;product_id&quot;])'
            metrics_result += f'Product Name: (row[&quot;product_name&quot;])'

    Make sure to replace unwanted character for each column and to convert value to the desired type before going into calculation. Also pay attention to the columns exact name. Data are represented as a json below but the file they came from is an xlsx. Your code should always start with :
        import pandas as pd
        data = CSV_FILE
        df = pd.read_csv(data)


    structure:
        {data_snippet}

    Metrics to retrieve:
        {metrics}


    python script:
&quot;&quot;&quot;
)

chain_two = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=second_prompt, output_key='script')

from langchain.chains import SimpleSequentialChain

overall_chain = SimpleSequentialChain(chains=[chain, chain_two], input_variables=['data_snippet_str'], output_variables=[&quot;metrics&quot;,&quot;script&quot;], verbose=True)

I would like to train a GPT model (3 or 4) to ingest these texts and then output how the locations, events, actions, participants, and things described in the texts are related to one another.

<p>If so can someone please point me in the right direction for learning how to do it? When I do searches all I'm finding is links about using GPT models to give extractive or abstractive summaries of individual texts. I suppose that's related but not quite the same.</p>

<p><a href=""https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning</a></p>
<p>The documentation says that the accuracy metrics are calculated respect to the completion. But for the loss it is said that it is calculated &quot;on the training batch&quot;.</p>
<p>My understanding is that the first training of a GPT model always happen in batches of max available size, using an special token to separate contexts but always asking to predict the next token for all the entries. So here the loss function is the obvious cross entropy over all the outputs. But in fine tuning, there is the opportunity to learn to predict the &quot;template prompt&quot; or not. Both decisions can be sensible; learning the template amounts to train a parsing, masking the template can avoid overfitting.</p>

<p>In documentation is recommended use of OpenAI tool for control.
Followed by documentation recommending format (&quot;Prompt:&quot;, &quot;Completion:&quot;)

<ol>
<li>Evaluating the sentiment of a single utterance in a conversational grouping</li>
<li>Evaluating a grouping of sentiment based on the statement from item 1 above and then adding a new utterance string to the predictor (the next utterance in the conversation) so that the predictor evaluates the previous string in context with the new string.  Note that the individual additive statement in this step would also receive a sentiment score</li>
<li>Repeating item 1 and 2 by adding a new utterance string to data to be evaluated (wherein the new 3rd string utterance gets evaluated but also is evaluated in the context of the previous 2 utterances - such that now there are three utterances to be evaluated in addition to the individual newly added string.<br />
For example:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Statement 1: Neutral
Statement 2:  Positive
Statement 1+2:  Neutral
Statement 3:  Negative
Statement 1+2+3:  Neutral
etc... 
</code></pre>
<p>I could then transform the classifications to integer values rather simply, and then come up with the mean of entire statement grouping for a final &quot;conversation&quot; sentiment classification.</p>
<p>Here is my list of utterances:</p>
<pre><code>conversation = [
&quot;Hi, how are you?&quot;,
&quot;I'm not doing very well, thanks for asking. How about you?&quot;,
&quot;It is the best of times and the worst of times.&quot;,
&quot;I'm not sure what to make of that.&quot;,
&quot;Do you have any plans for the weekend?&quot;,
&quot;Not yet, I'm still deciding.&quot;,
&quot;How about you?&quot;,
&quot;I'm planning to go hiking on Saturday.&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Here is my routine -</p>
<pre><code>#Define the size of the sliding window
window_size = 5
sentiment_scores = []
for i in range(len(conversation) - window_size + 1):
    # Get the window of utterances
    window = conversation[i:i+window_size]

    if i &lt; len(conversation) - window_size:
        window = conversation[i:i+window_size+1]
        print(&quot;This is the  window when a conversation has been added&quot;, window)

    # Join the utterances in the window into a single string
    text = &quot; &quot;.join(window)
    # print(text)

    # Use the OpenAI completion class to evaluate sentiment for the window
    response = openai.Completion.create(

    print(sentiment)

    # Add the sentiment score to the list
    sentiment_scores.append(sentiment)
    print(sentiment_scores)

<p>The code above is some examples I tried.
The last example is an English sentence and I can understand that <code>This</code> corresponds to <code>&quot;This&quot;:1212</code> in the <code>vocab.json</code>, <code> is</code> corresponds to <code>&quot;\u0120is&quot;: 318</code>.</p>
<p>But I can not understand why this tool tokenizes non-English sequence into some tokens I can not find in the vocab.
For example:
<code>東</code> is been tokenized into <code>30266 and 109</code>. The results in the <code>vocab.json</code> is <code>&quot;æĿ&quot;:30266</code> and <code>&quot;±&quot;:109</code>.
<code>メ</code> is been tokenized into <code>26998</code>. The results in the <code>vocab.json</code> is <code>&quot;ãĥ¡&quot;:26998</code>.</p>
<p>I searched the Huggingface documents and website and find no clue.</p>
<p>And the source code is written in Rust, which is hard for me to understand.
So could you help me figure out why?</p>

<p>As you can see, it's sent me back a list of topics related to &quot;digital marketing&quot; with some headlines (apparently from a to e). I see some line breaks and tabulation here and there. So my first reflex was to split the text on the line breaks, but it looks like the format is not equal everywhere, as there are very few line breaks in the second half of the response (which make it inaccurate).
What I'd like to do, is reformatting the output, so I can have a kind of list of topics and headlines. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>[
     {&quot;Topic 1&quot;: [&quot;headline 1&quot;, &quot;headline 2&quot;,&quot;...&quot;]},
     {&quot;Topic 2&quot;: [&quot;headline 1&quot;, &quot;headline 2&quot;,&quot;...&quot;]},
     {&quot;Topic 3&quot;: [&quot;headline 1&quot;, &quot;headline 2&quot;,&quot;...&quot;]}
]
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe there is a parameter to send over withing my request, but I didn't find anything in the doc. So I guess my best bet is to reformat using <code>regex</code>. Here I see a pattern <code>Topic:</code>and <code>Headlines:</code> but it's not always the case. What is consistent is the number prefixing each element <code>(like Ì., II., 1., 2. or a., b.)</code> but sometimes it looks like <code>a ..</code> (you can see that at the end of the response for example.</p>
<p>Any idea how to do that? (I'm using python for that, but can adapt from another language)</p>

I have a data set (n~20) which I'd like to train the model with more but there is no way to fine-tune these InstructGPT models, only base GPT models.</p>
<p>As I understand it I can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>A: Find a way to harvest 10x more data (I don't see an easy option here)</li>
<li>or B: Find a way to fine-tune Davinci into something capable of simpler InstructGPT behaviours</li>
</ul>
<p>(Please let me know if there's a third option. I've attempted to increase epochs from 4 to 10 but the quality is really nowhere near as good).</p>
<p>Is there any way to fine-tune Davinci up to the point where it can model some of the things Instruct does? I don't need full capabilities, but if I can make it narrowed down to my use case it would be ideal.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>By the way there is a common misconception that fine-tuning a GPT-3 model on a base (davinci, ada, babbage, etc...) will train it on the latest, eg: text-davinci-003. This is not how GPT works and is explained by GPT blog posts and support posts:
<a href=""https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6819989-can-i-fine-tune-on-text-davinci-003"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6819989-can-i-fine-tune-on-text-davinci-003</a></p>
<p>Please don't claim <code>openai api fine_tunes.create -t &quot;model_prepared.jsonl&quot; -m &quot;davinci&quot;</code> will create a model based on text-davinci-003, it is not true, it uses base davinci.</p>

<p>The API successfully performs a test code completion.  And it does not matter whether the API is making a single or multiple API request, both return the same warning.</p>
<p>The following results when using 3 queries:</p>

<p>After performing multiple unsuccessful web searches - including a search at Stack Overflow for information about these warnings, I found there exists almost no information about this warning anywhere.

For whatever reason, the last bits of my prompt somehow spill into it, at the start of it. Like there will be a period, or a question mark, or sometimes a few of the last letters from the prompt, that get removed from the prompt, and somehow find their way into BOTH the response that gets printed inside of the Visual Studio Code terminal, AND in the outputted version that gets written to a corresponding Excel spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Any reason why this might happen?</p>
<p>Some example responses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<p>Most apples are colored red.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also</p>
<blockquote>
<p>?</p>
<p>Most rocks are colored gray.</p>

<p>Another example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for it.</p>
<p>Most oceans are colored blue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The period, the question mark, &quot; for it&quot; somehow get transposed FROM the end of the prompt, and tacked onto the response. And they even get removed from the prompt that was originally in the Excel spreadsheet to begin with.</p>

I need to extend the time because I make an API call to openai and it sometimes takes longer than 5 seconds. My idea was to start the 2 functions in parallel. The broadbridge_webhook_results() function is there to extend the time by triggering a followupEventInput at Dialogflow after 3,5 seconds, so a new call comes through Dialogflow and the 5 seconds start from new. This goes apparently up to 2 times. In the meantime the API call should be made towards openai. As soon as the API call was successful, the answer should be sent back to Dialogflow.

<ol>
<li>You need to come out with a short paragraph, about a <strong>specific subject</strong></li>
<li>You must base your paragraph on a set of articles, 3-6 articles, written in an unknown structure</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is what I found to work well:</p>
<ol>
<li>The main constraint is the open ai token limit in the prompt</li>
<li>Due to the constraint, I'd ask OPT-3 to parse unstructured data using the specific subject in the prompt request.</li>
<li>I'll then iterate each article and save it all into 1 string variable</li>
<li>Then, repeat it one last time but using the new string variable</li>
<li>If the article is too long, I'll cut it into smaller chunks</li>
<li>Of curse fine-tune, the model with the specific subject before will produce much better results</li>
<li>The <code>temperature</code> should be set to <code>0</code>, to make sure GPT-3 uses only facts from the data source.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example:
Let's say I want to write a paragraph about Subject A, Subject B, and  Subject C. And I have 5 articles as references.
The open ai playground will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Example Article 1
----
Subject A: example A for OPT-3
Subject B: n/a
Subject c: n/a
=========
Example Article 2
----
Subject A: n/a

-----

<p>I am trying to summarise a journal entry <em>and</em> convert it into second person past tense (i.e. &quot;I went to the shop&quot; -&gt; &quot;You went to the shop&quot;).</p>
<p>When I give the following prompt to GPT-3 (Da Vinci, all other params normal), it gives me a summary as expected:</p>
<pre><code>Summarise this text:

We took to the streets of London on the London hire bikes aka Boris Bikes / BoJo Bikes; previously Barclays Bikes and now Santander Bikes – bloomin heck this is complicated.  I knew the direction where I wanted to get to and knew how to get there except I didn’t really.

We started our journey at one of bike hire station in St John’s Wood and continued around Regents Park (the wrong way) Simon got us to one of the gateways to the path along the Regents Canal.  Sometimes they can be quite difficult to find; this was one of those times. This particular one was located at the back of a housing estate; only that Simon knew where it was there was no way I would have found it.

Off down the canal we went. Sunday afternoons are a busy time along the canal with local people mixed in with tourists from all over the world; so cycling along a narrow path is not easy as everyone walks on different sides of the path (according to where they come from)! We got towards Camden Market and the path got very busy, to the point that I almost went into the canal but with a wibble and a wobble I managed to stay in.  At that point the decision was easily made to get off that bike and walk it. The Santander App showed us where the nearest parking station was and that there was space available to park up.

Coffee time! Forget the major chains, we found a small local place called T &amp; G for some cups of coffee and a sarnie before we went out to find out next bike to get us to Granary Square in Kings Cross for our next stop. From the canal path there is a grassed set of steps going up to the Square but first we parked up the bikes on the other side of the canal. So many places to choose from to hang out, for drinks and for food or trains to Paris, Lille, Edinburgh or Manchester to start off with.

All in all, we went out and achieved what we intended to – a cycle along the canal with a couple of stops along the way for some food and drinks.  What better way to spend a Sunday afternoon.

// GPT-3's answer:

The author takes a Boris Bike (a bike available for rent in London) and cycles along the Regents Canal. They note that the path is busy on a Sunday afternoon, but manage to find a parking spot for their bike before exploring the area around Granary Square in Kings Cross.
</code></pre>
<p>That is a very good summary.</p>
<p>Now, I can convert the summary to second person POV like so:</p>
<pre><code>Convert the following to past tense second person:

The author takes a Boris Bike (a bike available for rent in London) and cycles along the Regents Canal. They note that the path is busy on a Sunday afternoon, but manage to find a parking spot for their bike before exploring the area around Granary Square in Kings Cross.

// GPT-3's answer:

You took a Boris Bike and cycled along the Regents Canal. You noted that the path was busy on a Sunday afternoon, but managed to find a parking spot for your bike before exploring the area around Granary Square in Kings Cross.
</code></pre>
<p>Again, excellent! But if I combine the prompts like so:</p>
<p><code>Summarise the following and convert the result to past tense second person:</code></p>
<p>It doesn't work well at all - in fact it just seems to ignore the summarisation part of the prompt, i.e. it just converts the whole passage to second person past tense. How can I fix this?</p>

<p>Recipe web pages have a wide variety of structures, and they are notorious for including long and often irrelevant articles before the recipe, for the sake of SEO.</p>
<p>My plan was to use the fine-tuning API for davinci2, and feed it a bunch of straight up recipe HTML as input and cleaned, recipe-only markdown as output. I notice though that the maximum input token count for both training and inference is 4096. The HTML for a web page can be much larger than that, like 20k tokens.</p>
<p>I am wondering if anyone has found a workaround for training and driving GPT-3 with more tokens than 4096.</p>
<p>I'm open to other suggestions as well. For instance, I've considered passing just the visible text on the page, rather than the full HTML tree, but there is much less context present in that form, and the models seems more easily confused by all of the links and other navigational elements present in the page. I have also considered only allowing this project to accept &quot;printer-friendly&quot; versions of recipes, which tend to be much smaller and would easily come in under the 4096 token limit, but not all sites offer a printer-friendly article, and I don't want this to be a limitation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>model</strong></p>
<p>The name of the base model to fine-tune. You can select one of &quot;ada&quot;, &quot;babbage&quot;, &quot;curie&quot;, &quot;davinci&quot;, or a fine-tuned model created after 2022-04-21.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My question: is it better to fine-tune a base model or a fine-tuned model?</p>
<p>I created a fine-tune model from <code>ada</code> with file <code>mydata1K.jsonl</code>:</p>
<pre><code>ada + mydata1K.jsonl --&gt; ada:ft-acme-inc-2022-06-25
</code></pre>
<p>Now I have a bigger file of samples <code>mydata2K.jsonl</code> that I want to use to improve the fine-tuned model.
In this second round of fine-tuning, is it better to fine-tune <code>ada</code> again or to fine-tune my fine-tuned model <code>ada:ft-acme-inc-2022-06-25</code>?  I'm assuming this is possible because my fine tuned model is created after 2022-04-21.</p>
<pre><code>ada + mydata2K.jsonl --&gt; better-model

<p>or</p>

<p>the API key seems to be found in a process.env file that İ don't have, and when İ made a file named process.env and made a variable called OPENAI_API_KEY, but it didn't seem to work.

<p>The way i have solved it, is that i have an array of chat messages, that gets joined by newlines, and sent as the prompt to the API.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>arr.push(&quot;This is a conversation between you and an AI&quot;)
arr.push(&quot;You: Hello, how are you doing&quot;)
arr.push(&quot;AI: I'm great, how about you?&quot;)
arr.push(&quot;You: I'm good, thanks!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>I then push the next question asked to the array, and then push an empty &quot;AI:&quot; string for the OpenAI-endpoint to complete.</p>
<p>The resulting prompt for the API to complete looks like this</p>
<pre><code>```
This is a conversation between you and an AI
You: Hello, how are you doing
AI: I'm great, how about you?
You: I'm good, thanks!
You: How's the weather today?
AI:
```
</code></pre>
<p>The response will then also be pushed to the array, so the conversation can continue... (at this time i only send the last ~20 lines from the array)
However, the problem i have is that the &quot;bot&quot; will start repeating itself, seemingly at random times it will start answering something like &quot;great, how about you?&quot;, and whatever you send as the last question in the prompt, that will be the answer&quot;</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>```
This is a conversation between you and an AI
You: Hello, how are you doing
AI: I'm great, how about you?
You: I'm good, thanks!
You: How's the weather today?
AI: It is looking great!
You: That's nice, any plans for today?
AI: It is looking great!
You: What are you talking about?
AI: It is looking great!
```

<p>The only relevant thing i seem to have found in the documentation is the frequency_penalty and the presence_penalty. However, changing those doesnt seem to do much.</p>

    });

    return completion.data.choices[0].text.trim()

<p>I'm in charge of a voicebot, and I'm testing out the performance of GPT-3 for general open-conversation questions. I'd like to <a href=""https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tunes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">train</a> the model on the &quot;fixed&quot; intent-response pairs we're currently using: this would probably end up performing better in terms of company voice and style.</p>
<p>I have ready a long JSON file of data extracted from our current conversational engine, which matches user input to <strong>intents</strong> and returns the specified response. I'd like to train a GPT-3 model on this data.</p>
<p>As of now, for some quick testing, I've set up my calls to the API just like they <a href=""https://beta.openai.com/examples/default-chat"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">suggest</a>. I have a &quot;fixed&quot; intro text in the form</p>
<pre><code>&lt;name&gt; is &lt;company&gt;'s voicebot. he is kind and professional...

This is a conversation between &lt;name&gt; and a customer:
</code></pre>
<p>which is pre-pended to each query, and then a small python class which keeps track of the context which starts with</p>
<pre><code>User: &lt;request the user provides&gt;
Bot:
</code></pre>
<p>then with each turn the api's response is appended, this way I'm keeping track of what is said. After a few questions, the query or prompt string i'm sending looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;name&gt; is &lt;company&gt;'s voicebot. he is kind and professional...

This is a conversation between &lt;name&gt; and a user:

User: &lt;request&gt;
Bot: &lt;response&gt;
User: &lt;request&gt;
Bot: &lt;response&gt;
... and so on
Bot:
</code></pre>
<p>My question is, do i have to provide the same &quot;format&quot; for my training data? Is it advisable?
The <a href=""https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/prepare-training-data"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">docs</a> indicate that the training set should be in this format:</p>
<pre><code>{&quot;prompt&quot;: &quot;&lt;prompt text&gt;&quot;, &quot;completion&quot;: &quot;&lt;ideal generated text&gt;&quot;}
{&quot;prompt&quot;: &quot;&lt;prompt text&gt;&quot;, &quot;completion&quot;: &quot;&lt;ideal generated text&gt;&quot;}
...
</code></pre>
<p>But does the prompt need to include my intro text (the description) each time or do i simply provide a series of user/bot exchanges with a <code>Bot:</code> in the end and in the completion the answer i'd expect?
What would be a <em>best practice</em> in this case?
My fear is that if i wanted to slightly change the intro prompt a month from now I'd have to retrain the whole thing again because each response was trained with that specific block of text prepended.</p>

<p>For instance, if I ask &quot;¿Cómo estás?&quot; and there's a trained completion for that sentence: &quot;Estoy bien, ¿y tú?&quot;, the inference often returns exactly the same (which is good), but sometimes it adds non-encoded words: &quot;Estoy bien, ¿y tú? CuÃ©ntame algo de ti&quot;, adding &quot;Ã©&quot; instead of &quot;é&quot;.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it returns exactly the same sentence that was trained for, with no encoding issues.
I don't know if the inference is taking the non-encoded characters from my model or from somewhere else.</p>
<p>What should I do?
Should I encode the dataset in UTF-8?
Should I leave the dataset with UTF-8 and decode the bad encoded chars in the response?</p>
<p>The OpenAI docs for fine-tuning don't include anything about encoding.</p>

<p>So I was trying to implement the AI &quot;GPT-3&quot; into a discord bot to see how it would work, but GPT-3 needs to know the prompt (basically context of a conversation) all the time. With the way I have it set up, it constantly replaces the variable (msg.content) with new strings once they are grabbed by &quot;MessageCollector&quot;. I need to make it so that whenever a message is detected, it adds that string to the variable and constantly doing that until, lets say a timer goes off.</p>

<p>Andre thanks for the replies.</p>
<p>It seems my question is not clear enough. So let me elaborate.
Next-token prediction can be trained on normal text corpus.</p>
<pre><code>word1 w2 w3 w4 .....
</code></pre>
<p>Next Sentiment can be trained on sentence=&gt;marker=&gt;label</p>
<pre><code>sent1: word1 w2 w3 w4 ..... marker label1
sent2: word1 w2 w3 w4 ..... marker label2
sent3: word1 w2 w3 w4 ..... marker label3
....
</code></pre>
<p>It is no longer corpus-next-token-generation. It is next-token generation.
The problem is you need to have the LABALED data !!</p>
<p>How about text summation ... lets use keyword extraction (and eventually sentence selection based on those keywords)
Again u need even more complex labeling.</p>
<pre><code>  paragraph1 =&gt; kw1
  paragraph1 =&gt; kw2
  paragraph2 =&gt; kw3
  paragraph3 =&gt; kw4

<p>it still can be thought of as next-token prediction but you need again specialized LABELED data.</p>
